### Get list of Services
Look for services running under named accounts, or that you can overwrite the binary.
`Get-Service`

`Get-CimInstance` (Replaces `Get-WmiObject`)
`Get-CimInstance -ClassName win32_service | Select Name,State,PathName | Where-Object {$_.State -like 'Running'}`

`sc query`

### Check permissions of files
Check for (F) Full access permissions on executables (or config files) that you can overwrite.
`icacls`
`Get-ACL`

If you can, **overwrite the binary** and **restart the service**
`net stop <service>`
`net start <service>`

Or, **restart the machine**
If you want to restart the machine, you need `SeShutDownPrivilege`
`shutdown /r /t 0`
