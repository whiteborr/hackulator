# Application Cleanup Implementation

This document describes the cleanup functionality implemented to ensure proper shutdown of services when the Hackulator application exits.

## Overview

The application now properly handles cleanup of running services (Local DNS Server and VPN connections) when exiting through any of the following methods:

1. **Normal application close** (X button)
2. **System tray quit option**
3. **System signals** (Ctrl+C, SIGTERM)
4. **Automatic cleanup** (atexit handler)

## Implementation Details

### Main Entry Point (`main.py`)

- **Signal Handlers**: Registered for SIGINT and SIGTERM to handle graceful shutdown
- **Atexit Handler**: Registered cleanup function that runs when Python interpreter exits
- **Cleanup Function**: `cleanup_on_exit()` stops DNS server and disconnects VPN

### Main Window (`app/main_window.py`)

- **Enhanced closeEvent**: Calls cleanup before allowing application to close
- **Public cleanup method**: `cleanup_services()` for external access
- **Private cleanup method**: `_cleanup_services()` performs actual cleanup operations

### System Tray (`app/core/system_tray.py`)

- **Force quit method**: `force_quit_application()` triggers cleanup before exit
- **Bypasses tray dialog**: When quitting from tray, cleanup runs without confirmation

## Services Cleaned Up

### Local DNS Server
- Checks if server is running (`local_dns_server.running`)
- Calls `local_dns_server.stop_server()` to gracefully shutdown
- Logs cleanup action

### VPN Manager
- Checks if VPN is connected (`vpn_manager.is_connected`)
- Calls `vpn_manager.disconnect()` to terminate connection
- Logs cleanup action

## Error Handling

All cleanup operations are wrapped in try-catch blocks to prevent cleanup failures from blocking application exit. Errors are logged but don't prevent shutdown.

## Testing

Use `test_cleanup.py` to verify cleanup functionality:

```bash
python test_cleanup.py
```

This script tests:
- DNS server start/stop cycle
- VPN disconnect (if connected)
- Cleanup function execution

## Usage Examples

### Manual Cleanup
```python
from app.main_window import MainWindow

# Get main window instance
main_window = MainWindow()

# Manually trigger cleanup
main_window.cleanup_services()
```

### Programmatic Exit with Cleanup
```python
import sys
from main import cleanup_on_exit

# Perform cleanup before exit
cleanup_on_exit()
sys.exit(0)
```

## Benefits

1. **Data Integrity**: Ensures services are properly stopped
2. **Resource Cleanup**: Prevents orphaned processes
3. **Security**: Disconnects VPN connections on exit
4. **Reliability**: Multiple exit paths all trigger cleanup
5. **Logging**: All cleanup actions are logged for debugging

## Future Enhancements

- Add cleanup for additional services as they're implemented
- Implement timeout handling for cleanup operations
- Add user notification for cleanup progress on slow operations
