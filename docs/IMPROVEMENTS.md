## üîß RPC ENUMERATION IMPROVEMENTS

---

## ‚úÖ Implemented Improvements

### 1. Structured Output for UI Integration
- Introduced a consistent JSON structure for scan results:
  ```json
  {
    "host": "192.168.1.10",
    "os": "Windows 11 Pro",
    "shares": ["C$", "inetpub"],
    "ports": [135, 139, 445],
    "rpc_interfaces": [
      "uuid: 1234-5678 svcctl",
      "uuid: 5678-90ab eventlog",
      ...
    ]
  }
  ```
- Enables seamless UI data binding for tables and visual graphs.
- Ensures output can be logged, exported, and reused in post-processing.

### 2. System Info Retrieval Improvements
- Primary method: Native Windows command `systeminfo` with optional credentials:
  ```bash
  systeminfo /s <target> /u <user> /p <password>
  ```
- Fallback: Registry-based OS info enumeration using:
  ```bash
  reg query \\<target>\HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion /v ProductName
  ```
- Accounts for restricted UAC policies and disabled RemoteRegistry service.
- Annotates failures in the UI with actionable suggestions (e.g., enabling services, adjusting UAC).

### 3. Network Share Enumeration
- Executes the following logic:
  - Authenticated: `net use` to initiate IPC$ session
  - Listing: `net view \\target` to enumerate available shares
- Parses typical shares like `ADMIN$`, `C$`, and custom shares.
- Filters and formats output with annotations for accessibility or error states (e.g., access denied).

### 4. RPC Endpoint Mapping
- Added optional call to `rpcdump.py` to discover:
  - Active RPC endpoints
  - Interface UUIDs
  - Associated named pipes and bindings
- Top 10 most relevant interfaces shown in output (e.g., `svcctl`, `eventlog`, `spoolss`)
- Highlights potentially vulnerable interfaces
- Automatically detects and logs absence of `rpcdump.py` without crashing

### 5. Open RPC Port Scanner
- Performs direct TCP connectivity checks to commonly used RPC-related ports:
  - `135` ‚Äì RPC Endpoint Mapper
  - `139` ‚Äì NetBIOS Session Service
  - `445` ‚Äì SMB
  - `1024‚Äì1026` ‚Äì Dynamic RPC ports (legacy range)
- Results are recorded as a structured list and reported with appropriate visual cues

### 6. RPC Endpoint Mapping
- Added optional call to `rpcdump.py` to discover:
  - Active RPC endpoints

- Integrated into structured output with `domain_users` and `domain_groups` fields
- Limited results display (top 10 users, top 8 groups) for UI performance
- Requires authenticated access (username + password/hash)

### 9. Advanced Enumeration Modules - LSARPC Interface
- `lsarpc` interface enumeration via rpcclient:
  - Domain SID extraction (`lsaquery`)
  - Trust relationships enumeration (`lsaenumsid`)
  - Policy information retrieval

- Severity classification (High/Medium/Low)
- Vulnerability descriptions and interface identification
- Integrated into structured output with `vulnerabilities` field

### 11. RID Cycling Logic

  - High-privileged RID identification (500, 512, 516, 518, 519)
  - Standard user RID enumeration (1000+)
- SID-to-name resolution via `lookupsids` command
- Privilege level classification (High/Standard)
- Integrated into structured output with `rid_users` field
- Limited to 15 results for performance

### 12. WKSSVC Interface Enumeration
- `wkssvc` interface enumeration via rpcclient:
  - Computer name and domain information
  - OS version and workstation details
  - Logged-in users enumeration
  - Network share count and accessibility
- Integrated into structured output with `workstation_info` field
- Fallback to share enumeration when direct WKSSVC fails

- Added scan type selection (Basic Info, Full Enumeration, Vulnerability Scan, Complete Assessment)
- Warning banners for Windows 11 compatibility issues:
  - RemoteRegistry service disabled notifications
  - UAC token filtering alerts
- Improved control layout with scan type categorization

- Protected behind privilege confirmation prompt
- Secure handling - hashes not displayed in UI
- Integrated into structured output with `secrets` field

- Detection of NTLM-authenticating RPC interfaces:
  - PrinterBug/SpoolSample relay potential (spoolss)
  - PetitPotam relay vectors (lsarpc/efsr)
  - Service control interface abuse (svcctl)
- SMB signing enforcement detection:
  - Identifies relay-vulnerable configurations
  - Warns when signing not enforced
