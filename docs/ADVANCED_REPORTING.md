## Usage

### GUI Integration

The Advanced Reporting feature is integrated into the enumeration page:

1. Run a scan to generate results
2. Select "Advanced Report" from the Export dropdown
3. Choose report type, format, and options
4. Generate comprehensive reports

### Programmatic Usage

```python
from app.core.advanced_reporting import advanced_reporting

# Sample scan data
scan_data = {
    'target': 'example.com',
    'scan_type': 'dns_enum',
    'results': {...},
    'timestamp': '2024-01-01T12:00:00'
}

# Generate PDF report
success, filepath, message = advanced_reporting.generate_comprehensive_report(
    scan_data, 'technical', 'pdf'
)

# Generate HTML report
success, filepath, message = advanced_reporting.generate_comprehensive_report(
    scan_data, 'executive', 'html'
)
```

## File Structure

```
app/core/advanced_reporting.py      # Core reporting engine
app/widgets/advanced_reporting_widget.py  # GUI interface
docs/ADVANCED_REPORTING.md          # This documentation
test_advanced_reporting.py          # Test script
```

## Dependencies

### Required
- Python 3.8+
- PyQt6 (for GUI integration)

### Optional
- ReportLab 4.0+ (for PDF generation)
- Matplotlib (for advanced charts)

## Installation

The Advanced Reporting Engine is included with Hackulator. For PDF support:

```bash
pip install reportlab>=4.0.0
```

## Testing

Run the test script to validate functionality:

```bash
python test_advanced_reporting.py
```

This will generate sample reports in multiple formats using test data.

## Report Examples

### Executive Summary Output
```
Executive Summary
=================
This comprehensive security assessment of example.com identified 6 findings 
with an overall risk level of MEDIUM. Several security concerns require 
prompt attention.

Risk Assessment
- High Risk: 2 items
- Medium Risk: 1 item  
- Low Risk: 3 items

Key Findings
- High subdomain exposure (6 subdomains discovered)
- Sensitive subdomains exposed: admin.example.com, test.example.com

Recommendations
- Review and secure exposed subdomains
- Implement comprehensive asset discovery
- Enhance monitoring capabilities
```

### Technical Analysis Output
```
Technical Statistics
===================
Total Records: 8
Record Type Distribution:
- A: 6
- CNAME: 1
- MX: 1
- TXT: 1

Attack Surface Analysis
- Entry Points: 6 subdomains discovered
- Surface Score: 12/100
- Risk Factors: Large attack surface due to numerous subdomains
```

## Integration

### With Existing Tools
The Advanced Reporting Engine integrates seamlessly with:
- DNS Enumeration results
- Port Scan results
- HTTP Fingerprinting results
- All other Hackulator tools

### With External Systems
- JSON output for SIEM integration
- HTML reports for web dashboards
- PDF reports for documentation and compliance

## Customization

### Custom Templates
Create custom report templates by extending the base template structure:

```python
custom_template = {
    'include_charts': True,
    'include_recommendations': True,
    'include_compliance': False,
    'custom_sections': ['custom_analysis'],
    'branding': {'logo': 'path/to/logo.png'}
}
```

### Custom Analysis
Extend the analysis engine with custom risk assessment rules:

```python
def custom_risk_analysis(scan_data):
    # Custom risk analysis logic
    return risk_assessment
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **PDF Generation Fails**
   - Install ReportLab: `pip install reportlab>=4.0.0`
   - Check file permissions in exports directory

2. **Empty Reports**
   - Ensure scan data is properly formatted
   - Verify scan results are not empty

3. **GUI Integration Issues**
   - Check PyQt6 installation
   - Verify widget imports

### Debug Mode
Enable debug logging for troubleshooting:

```python
import logging
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)
```

## Performance

### Optimization Tips
- Use JSON format for large datasets
- Enable caching for repeated analysis
- Batch process multiple reports
- Use threading for GUI responsiveness

### Memory Usage
- Reports are generated in memory-efficient chunks
- Large datasets are processed incrementally
- Automatic cleanup after generation

## Security Considerations

### Data Handling
- Scan results are processed locally
- No external data transmission
- Secure file permissions on reports
- Sanitized output to prevent injection

### Report Security
- PDF reports include metadata protection
- HTML reports use safe rendering
- JSON output is properly escaped

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features
- Interactive dashboard reports
- Real-time report updates
- Advanced charting and visualization
- Multi-language report support
- Cloud storage integration
- Automated report scheduling

### API Extensions
- REST API for report generation
- Webhook integration
- Third-party tool integration
- Custom plugin support
