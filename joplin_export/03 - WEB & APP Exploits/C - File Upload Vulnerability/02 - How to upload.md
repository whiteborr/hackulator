## Upload other filetypes
1. Once finding a location that you can upload files like images, test if you can upload *other* filetypes (txt, php, exe)

## PHP extension blacklisted
If you get the error:
`PHP files are not allowed! All PHP extensions are blacklisted`
1. Try renaming with lesson know PHP file extensions:
**.phps**
**.php7**
2. Try renaming the file extenstion with **UPPERCASE** 
eg (.PHP or .pHP)

## Encode the file
1. Use script **Encode text to UNICODE (powershell)**
2. Upload the UNICODE file using **curl**. 
Note: If web server is IIS, use with the **powershell -enc** command
`curl http://target/uploads/simple-backdoor.pHP?cmd=powershell%20-enc%20XXXXXXXXXXXXUNICODEXTEXTXXXXXXXXXXXXX`

## Directory Traversal
1. Try to upload the file using relative path for the filename:
`filename="../../../../../../../../file.txt"`
