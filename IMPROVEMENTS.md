- Advanced UI themes provide multiple color schemes (Dark, Light, Cyberpunk, Matrix, Ocean)
- Unit test implementation provides automated testing for core functionality
- Integration tests validate component interactions and complete workflows
- Code documentation provides comprehensive API reference and development guides
- Plugin architecture enables extensible functionality with custom tools and scripts
- API integration capabilities provide external service connectivity (Shodan, VirusTotal, custom APIs)
- Threat intelligence feeds enable IOC checking against malware and phishing databases
- Machine learning pattern detection provides automated analysis and anomaly detection
- Distributed scanning support enables multi-node scanning for improved performance and scale
- All major roadmap features have been successfully implemented
- Maintain backward compatibility in future updates

## New Feature Ideas

Here are some ideas for new features that could take your toolkit to the next level:

- Session Management: Allow users to save and load their work, including targets, scan results, and notes.
- Project Management: Let users create and manage projects, each with its own scope, targets, and findings.
- Advanced Reporting: Build on your exporter.py to create a more powerful reporting engine that can generate professional-looking reports in various formats (e.g., PDF, HTML).
- Plugin Architecture: Create a plugin system that allows users to add their own custom tools and scripts.
- Integration with Other Tools: Integrate "Hackulator" with other popular penetration testing tools like Metasploit, Burp Suite, and Nmap.
- Vulnerability Database: Integrate a local or remote vulnerability database (like a local copy of Exploit-DB) to provide more information about discovered vulnerabilities.
- Automated Scanning: Add the ability to create and run automated scan profiles that can perform a series of tests against a target.
